    WHAT IS THIS PAGE?
    
    This is an original portfolio web page designed by Kent Ball. It will be updated with additional contents and styling in the coming months. For now, you can see a navigation bar fixed at the top of the viewport, which has a responsive size for any screen. There is a Welcome section, a Projects section (using a flexbox to control the flow of current and future project items), a Contact section and a footer. The styling is designed with a professional appearance, using a contrasting color scheme to help visually impaired users. 

    WHAT CHANGES WILL COME IN THE FUTURE? 

      Future updates will include new sections and with additional content. The links in the projects section will be replaced with actual projects once they are completed. The contact section will be updated with other methods of contact, such as a Linked In page and an email address. Style updates will be constant and considerable.
